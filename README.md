## Wrangle and Analyze Twitter Data 
Data Cleaning, Analying and Visualization, using the tweet archive of Twiitter user @dog_rates also known as WeRateDogs.

## Description
I analysed this tweet archive data by following steps. 

1. I read the required files such as csv, tsv and json files, accessed and defined the data's quality and tydiness issues. 
2. I clearned these data using python(Pandas) for further analysis, removing unneeded columns and rows, wrongly captured data in the wrangling process, and tyding up by combining those three dataframes. 
3. Using matplotlib and python, I conducted exploratory and explanatory data analysis.
