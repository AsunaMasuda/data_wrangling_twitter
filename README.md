## Wrangle and Analyze Twitter Data 
Data Cleaning, Analying and Visualization, using the tweet archive of Twiitter user @dog_rates also known as WeRateDogs.

## Description
I analysed this tweet archive data by following steps. 

1. Using python and Pandas, I read csv, tsv and json files which contain the archives of @dog_rates account. Next, I accessed each dataframes and defined the data's quality and tidiness issues. 
2. I clearned those quality and tidiness issues using python and Pandas for further analysis, removing unneeded columns/rows and wrongly captured data in the wrangling process, and tyding up by combining those three dataframes. 
3. Using matplotlib and python, I conducted exploratory and explanatory data analysis.
